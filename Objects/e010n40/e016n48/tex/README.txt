This is the texture folder of osm2city.py
Models generated by osm2city will use these textures.
It is stored in a separate repository osm2city-data on gitorious.

When you run osm2city, it will
- read textures in tex.src/
- generate a texture atlas "atlas_facades.png" and its light-map
- and store it in here.

Distribute your tex/ folder along with your scenery.

Before editing a texture here, please check whether it has an equivalent .xcf in tex.src/. If so, edit that and export to .png.
